# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Status Report

## ✅ **GitHub Actions Issues - RESOLVED**

- ✅ No more build failures from GitHub Actions  
- ✅ Repository cleaned and focused on Vercel deployment only

## 🔍 **Current Issue: Complete Vercel Site 404**

## 🎯 **ACTION REQUIRED: Check Vercel Dashboard**
**You need to verify your Vercel project status:**

1. **Login to Vercel**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find Project**: Look for "Port-San-Antonio" or similar project name
3. **Check Connection**: Ensure GitHub repository is connected
4. **Review Deployments**: Check deployment history and build logs
5. **If Missing**: Reconnect GitHub repo to new Vercel project

### Step 4: Domain Setup (Optional)
- Add custom domains in Vercel dashboard
- DNS configuration is automatic

### Configuration Files:
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Already created with security headers and redirects
- ❌ `netlify.toml` - Can be removed after successful Vercel deployment

### Key Advantages of Vercel for Next.js:
- Native Next.js support (Vercel created Next.js)
- Automatic edge deployment
- Better build performance
- Easier ownership transfer
- Advanced analytics and monitoring

### Build Command Verification:
The project builds successfully with:
```bash
npm run build
```

All Arabic translations, currency conversion, and PWA features are working correctly.
