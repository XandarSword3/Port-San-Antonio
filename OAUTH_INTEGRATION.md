# OAuth Integration Guide

You're absolutely right that third-party authentication would be more secure! Here are the recommended approaches:

## Option 1: Auth0 (Recommended)
```bash
npm install @auth0/nextjs-auth0
```

**Benefits:**
- Industry-standard security
- Social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Audit logs
- No password management needed

## Option 2: NextAuth.js
```bash
npm install next-auth
```

**Benefits:**
- Built for Next.js
- Multiple providers (Google, GitHub, Discord, etc.)
- Database or JWT sessions
- TypeScript support

## Option 3: Clerk
```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

**Benefits:**
- Beautiful pre-built components
- User management dashboard
- Social logins
- Email verification

## Option 4: Supabase Auth
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Benefits:**
- Email/password + social logins
- Row-level security
- Database included
- Realtime subscriptions

## Implementation Priority:
1. **For production:** Use Auth0 or Clerk (most secure, professional)
2. **For development:** Current JWT system is fine
3. **For open source:** NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth

## Security Comparison:
- **Current JWT system:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Basic security, good for development)
- **OAuth with third-party:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Enterprise-grade security)

Would you like me to implement OAuth integration with any of these providers?
